# Pacman (Single Level Replica)
<p>
  This pacman replica program is written in C++ and requires an environment which has access to the graphics.h header file. The TurboC++ environment is recommended to run this program.
  This program's code uses the path string "C:\\TurboC3\\BGI" to the initgraph() function so make sure that you've installed the turboC++ IDE in this path.

<p>
To play the game, press the "O" key on your keyboard after running the program. Then you may use the A-S-W-D keys to control the direction of pacman. This game currently only provides basic functionalities such as allowing pacman to move in a direction, eating orbs, eating ghosts when they are blue in color (in vulnerable state) and a few extra things such as the vulnerable state for ghosts ending within a few seconds.
